After 8 years working in finance, I decided to challenge myself and move to an industry where I can really make an impact on people's lives. 
Coding is something I’ve always enjoyed since the university, but I’ve never had a chance to really work with it on a daily basis. As I realised that technology is everywhere in our daily life I thought I wanted to be part of this world. And it's not just about being able to create something that is useful and can make our life easier. It's also about being challenged and learn new things each day. 

This is why I quit my full time job to enrol at Makers Academy, a world-renowned 16-week developer course, and become a software developer.
