I am a dedicated and enthusiastic full stack developer, who has just graduated from [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). After 8 years working in finance, I decided to challenge myself and move to an industry where I can really make an impact on people's lives.
I am motivated to join a company where I can share my passion and my skills, while consolidating and extending my programming knowledge.
